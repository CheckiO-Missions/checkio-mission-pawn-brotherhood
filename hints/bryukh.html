        The idea is as follows. You have a list with the coordinates of the placement of pawns. Convert it to the form of a matrix, like a checkerboard.
         With the help of this matrix, you will be able to calculate the relative position of the pawns among themselves and determine how many of them are safe.

        As a first step, let's convert our pawn coordinates to a numeric style so that we can then work with them like
        a matrix. To do this, we will use int() so that the number from the string becomes an integer data type, and we
        will return the letter in the form of an integer to which it corresponds in unicode using the ord() function.
        <pre class="brush: python">
for p in pawns:
    row = int(p[1])
    col = ord(p[0])
        </pre>
        In order for our coordinates to start from 0 and to make it easier to count, let's add something else.
        <pre class="brush: python">
for p in pawns:
    row = int(p[1]) - 1
    col = ord(p[0]) - 97
        </pre>
        In this way, we made it so that the letter "a" returns 0, not 97, and instead of "1" in the coordinates, we will
        have 0. That is, instead of "a:1" == "97:1", we will get "a:1" == "0:0" as origin.

    <div class="answer">
       We can add our transformed coordinates to a variable called "pawns_indexes". We will add all our combinations to it.
        <pre class="brush: python">
pawns_indexes = []
for p in pawns:
    row = int(p[1]) - 1
    col = ord(p[0]) - 97
    pawns_indexes.append((row, col))
        </pre>
        Or you can write this entire algorithm in the form of a list generator.
        <pre class="brush: python">
pawns_indexes = [(int(i[1]), ord(i[0])) for i in pawns]

        Nothing works. SOS
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        We need to add another for loop in which we check to see if the pawn is safe using our list of positions.
        <pre class="brush: python">
pawns_indexes = [(int(i[1]), ord(i[0])) for i in pawns]
for x, y in pawns_id:
        if ((x - 1, y - 1) in pawns_id) or ((x - 1, y + 1) in pawns_indexes):
            # bla bla
        </pre>
        A pawn is safe when there are other pawns in positions behind it, diagonally to the left and/or right.

        You have a few things left. Add a variable "count" in which you will count the number of safe pawns, wrap the code in a function, and return "count".
        <pre class="brush: python">
def safe_pawns(pawns: set) -> int:
    pawns_indexes = [(int(i[1]), ord(i[0])) for i in pawns]
    count = 0
    for x,y in pawns_id:
        if ((x - 1, y - 1) in pawns_id) or ((x - 1, y + 1) in pawns_indexes):
            count += 1
    return count

        A somewhat similar solution, only implemented through two functions. In the first, they calculate the pawns
        that are behind the current pawn, and in the second, they already check whether the current pawn is safe.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def getdiags(pawn):
    c, r = map(ord, pawn)
    return chr(c - 1) + chr(r - 1), chr(c + 1) + chr(r - 1)

def safe_pawns(pawns):
    return len([p for p in pawns if any(d in pawns for d in getdiags(p))])
        </pre>

    <div class="answer">
        This is how you can implement the solution using the any() and sum() function.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def safe_pawns(pawns):
    return sum((any(chr(ord(l) + i) + str(int(d) - 1) in pawns for i in [-1, 1])) for l, d in pawns)
        </pre>
